            A child starting school in to 2017 will be retiring in 2077. Nobody
            has a clue what world look like in 5 years time and yet we are meant
            to be educating them for it. (Sir Keneth Robinson 2006)

            This is “knowledge age” in which knowledge and ideas are main source
            of economic growth (more important than money, resources etc).
            Technological innovations are continuing to rapidly change the world
            around us. There is information overload and the amount of
            information in world is doubling every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our current world and inevitable & uncertain changes in future call
            for education to equip every student with appropriate set of skills.
            Academic skills such as mastery of science, Math, English, reading
            are necessary but not sufficient.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our children increasingly need to be able to develop ideas, solve
            problems empathize with others; they also need to have resilience
            and adaptability to continue to learn and master new skills. I think
            indeed these non academic skills are among the most important skills
            of all as they can help to both drive better academic out comes in
            school and prepare children to thrive and prosper in changing world.
          </p>

            We at RPS focus on following creativity, communication skills,
            problem solving, adaptability and more importantly want to train our
            students in ‘’the art and process and learning’’ so that they can
            deal with change and learn new skill quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other big challenge Society is facing is rapid decline of moral
            values. We at RPS also believe that education without values, as
            useful as it is, seems, to make a man more clever devil.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issues of making moral & ethical decision are significant in
            these new times of rapid social, cultural, political & technological
            change. School students need to be guided into making moral &
            ethical choices. We strongly emphasize building of character through
            teaching & practicing sound moral values & cultural values.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to produce a force of creative, flexible, adaptive, quick
            learners with strong character based on sound cultural & more
            values.
