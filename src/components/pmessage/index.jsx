          A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Our School
          came into being in 2008-2009 with 75 students and today it imparts
          education to approximately 1000 students. The school is committed to
          its vision of Making Quality Education accessible and rendering
          valuable services to the community. RPS promises to root its students
          in self- discipline and integrity, teaches them to exhibit mutual
          respect, demonstrates how to pursue excellence and creates lifelong
          learners who are sensitive to the needs of the environment. RPS is a
          progressive school and it has been our Endeavour to create meaningful
          learning engagements and opportunities that give our students a sense
          of achievement and a strong value base so that they become responsible
          stewards of society. Fostering students achievements and high
          performances is the RPS ethos which arises from continuous evaluation
          of every single student in academics and personality development. We
          train our students to be knowledgeable, skilled, confident and
          articulate but at the same time modest and humble. We make sure that
          each and every student find a place in this community and get
          opportunity. Education is not filling the mind with a lot of facts. We
          want that education by which character is formed, strength of mind is
          increased, the intellect is expanded and by which one can stand on
          one's own feet. Education is the manifestation of the perfection
          already in each one of us. Ms. Deepshikha Agrawal
